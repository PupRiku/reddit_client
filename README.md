# Project Requirements

## Summary
This project is part of Codecademy's [Full-Stack](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) and [Front-End](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) Engineer career paths. The project is meant to give practice React, Redux, Jest, Enzyme, and Selenium, along with expanding upon other previous topics.

## Project Instructions
For this project, you will build an application for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) using everything youâ€™ve learned, including React and Redux. Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.

### Project Objectives:
* Build the application using React and Redux
* Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
* Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work
* Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
    * Wireframes
    * Technologies used
    * Features
    * Future work
* Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme
* Write end-to-end tests for your application
* Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
* Users can use the application on any modern browser
* Users can access your application at a URL
* Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app
* Users can search the data using terms
* Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined
* Users are shown a detail view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item
* Users are delighted with a cohesive design system
* Users are delighted with animations and transitions
* Users are able to leave an error state
* Get 90+ scores on [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/)
    * We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.
* OPTIONAL: [Get a custom domain name and use it for your application](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/setting-up-your-domain/)
* OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes
* OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app

### Prerequisites:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
